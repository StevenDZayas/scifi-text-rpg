#3/7/21: Implemented attack sets for both the player and enemy classes; added an "attack enemy" prompt for the current prototype "Home Invader" enemy, present in b2;
#added a combat function that checks health of enemy, and infinitely asks for player input while enemy health is above zero; takes in user input, converts to attack, and deducts attack value from
#enemy health. Once enemy health is <=0, enemy is declared dead, combat function is exited, and attacking the same enemy will give the same death declaration, and not continue combat.

#Next steps: Set up Home Invader enemy to only be inspectable and attackable while player is in the same location, b2. Generalize this for all future enemies. Add enemy attack turn to the combat function.

#3/11/21: Added an empty list to each zone entry in the zonemap dictionary, which can house enemies in that zone. When an enemy populates that zone, both the dictionary entry is updated, AND the enemy instance attribute of
#enemy.location is updated to reflect that zone name. Then, when in that area, the player can "inspect" or "examine", and the display will tell us that there is an enemy nearby. We can then inspect the enemy, and engage in combat.

#Next steps: Refine the combat system for the Home Invader enemy encounter, such that the home invader can attack you in turn-based combat. Attack values for the enemy should be random, but he should be weak enough that
#only repeated attacks without countering by the player will result in player death. If player health <=0, add some kind of death mechanic.
